# Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

1. **`numpy`**:
   - Used for handling numerical operations and managing arrays, such as satellite position data.

2. **`astropy`**:
   - Provides tools for astronomical calculations, including handling time formats (`Time` objects) and performing coordinate transformations between different systems (e.g., RA/Dec to Alt/Az).

3. **`pandas`**:
   - Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for reading and cleaning satellite data from CSV files.

4. **`unittest`**:
   - Pythonâ€™s built-in testing framework, used for running unit tests to ensure that the code functions as expected.

# Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your Windows system. This project has been developed using Python 3.11 on Windows 11.

## Installation of Dependencies

To install the dependencies, use the following command within your Command Prompt (cmd):

```bash
pip install numpy astropy pandas
```

## Installation of satellite-visibility-checker:

Note these are example locations - please update with your own preferences.

1. **Make new temporary directory for cloning purposes**:
Enter the following commands within your Command Prompt (cmd).
   ```bash
   mkdir C:\Temp
   ```
   ```bash
   cd C:\Temp
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
Enter the following commands within your Command Prompt (cmd).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/James0306/satellite-visibility-checker.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd satellite-visibility-checker
   ```

# Usage of Satellite Visibility Analysis

This section outlines how to use the Satellite Visibility Analysis script to determine the visibility of a satellite from a specified ground station.

1. **Prepare Your Input Data**:
   Ensure you have a CSV file named 'satellite_positions.csv' which contains satellite position data in the following specified format with an initial line for the headings:
   - `Time (iso)`: ISO formatted timestamps (e.g., `2024-09-11T00:00:00Z`)
   - `RA (GCRS) [deg]`: Right Ascension in degrees (e.g., `87.958413`)
   - `Dec (GCRS) [deg]`: Declination in degrees (e.g., `-39.063465`)
   - `Distance (GCRS) [km]`: Distance from the center of the Earth in kilometers (e.g., `7067.917061`)

2. **Run the Script**:
   Open your Command Prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the main script using the following commands:
   ```bash
   python satellite_visibility.py
   ```

3. **Read the Results**:
   A file will be generated called 'visible_times.csv' within the satellite-visibility-checker directory. This will store the dates and times that the satellite is visible from the ground station.

# Unit Tests for Satellite Visibility Analysis

This section provides information on how to run unit tests for the Satellite Visibility Analysis project. The unit tests ensure that the main functionality of the project works as expected.

## Test Coverage

The unit tests cover the following scenarios:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensures that the `Time (iso)` column is correctly processed, and any missing or invalid data is removed.
2. **Time Conversion:** Verifies that the `Time (iso)` values are correctly converted to `astropy.time.Time` objects.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Confirms that the satellite's RA, Dec, and Distance are transformed into Altitude and Azimuth using the ground station's location.

To ensure full coverage of the code, consider adding additional tests for edge cases, including handling of malformed CSV data or boundary conditions for elevation.

## Running the Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m unittest test_satellite_visibility.py
```

# Uninstallation

If satisfied with the results of the satellite_visibility.py, test_satellite_visibility.py and output visible_times.csv, then we can uninstall the satellite-visibility-directory to clean up your device. Enter the following command into command prompt to delete the directory:
```bash
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Temp\satellite-visibility-checker" -Recurse -Force
```
